# Nome
## The Story of Nome

We set out to create a 2D top-down perspective game, called the Story of Nome. The game sees the player take control of Nome, the gameâ€™s protagonist. Nome must battle against beetles to stay alive. He does this by pushing a ball around to hit them, however if he is hit by a beetle, he dies instantly. 

Our game was inspired by similar games played from a top-down perspective such as Zelda, Chips Challenge, Enigma, and Labyrinth. We hoped to deliver a roguelike experience pioneered by games like spelunky, that make for a challenging experience.
